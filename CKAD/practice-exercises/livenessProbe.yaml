KIND:       Pod
VERSION:    v1

FIELD: livenessProbe <Probe>


DESCRIPTION:
    Periodic probe of container liveness. Container will be restarted if the probe fails. Cannot be updated. More info:
    https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes
    Probe describes a health check to be performed against a container to
    determine whether it is alive or ready to receive traffic.
    
FIELDS:
  exec	<ExecAction>
    Exec specifies a command to execute in the container.

  failureThreshold	<integer>
    Minimum consecutive failures for the probe to be considered failed after
    having succeeded. Defaults to 3. Minimum value is 1.

  grpc	<GRPCAction>
    GRPC specifies a GRPC HealthCheckRequest.

  httpGet	<HTTPGetAction>
    HTTPGet specifies an HTTP GET request to perform.

  initialDelaySeconds	<integer>
    Number of seconds after the container has started before liveness probes are
    initiated. More info:
    https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes

  periodSeconds	<integer>
    How often (in seconds) to perform the probe. Default to 10 seconds. Minimum
    value is 1.

  successThreshold	<integer>
    Minimum consecutive successes for the probe to be considered successful
    after having failed. Defaults to 1. Must be 1 for liveness and startup.
    Minimum value is 1.

  tcpSocket	<TCPSocketAction>
    TCPSocket specifies a connection to a TCP port.

  terminationGracePeriodSeconds	<integer>
    Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully upon
    probe failure. The grace period is the duration in seconds after the
    processes running in the pod are sent a termination signal and the time when
    the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer
    than the expected cleanup time for your process. If this value is nil, the
    pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this value
    overrides the value provided by the pod spec. Value must be non-negative
    integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via the kill signal (no
    opportunity to shut down). This is a beta field and requires enabling
    ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate. Minimum value is 1.
    spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds is used if unset.

  timeoutSeconds	<integer>
    Number of seconds after which the probe times out. Defaults to 1 second.
    Minimum value is 1. More info:
    https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes
